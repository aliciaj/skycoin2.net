		<h2>The Skycoin Story</h2>

		<p>Skycoin’s first line of code was written in 2012. At the time, Bitcoin’s popularity garnered equal parts interest and apprehension from the financial services community. The community realized that while early investment could mean tremendous returns, however, few in the field possessed the expertise to fully vet the technology behind it. So they enlisted the help of code and crypto experts to conduct an audit. </p>

		<p>The audit team assembled would become Skycoin’s first developers.</p>

		<p>What started as an audit into the cryptocurrency’s volatility, became a six year project of writing to resolving issues such as duplicate Coinbase outputs, signature immutability, transaction immutability, and the critical one: Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm Proof-of-Work.</p>
