<h1>Skycoin: A cryptocurrency incentivizing decentralization, powering the blockchain internet  </h1>

<h2>Skycoin is the only cryptocurrency that doesn’t build in economic incentives for centralization</h2>

<h3>First and second generation cryptocurrencies were built on systems that were always going to devolve into centralization: Skycoin isn’t. </h3>

<p>In first generation crypros, proof-of-work concentrated influence among mining pools based on who can supply the resource intensive miners with cheap power. In second generation cryptos, proof-of-stake gave more and more power to those who had a greater stake, creating incentivization of centralization. </p>
<p>These systematic tendencies towards centralization are diametrically opposed to the principle behind blockchain technology: The strength and advantages of decentralization. External economic factors meant that those with cheap power were more incentivised and able to mine—thus centralization began to creep up in first generation cryptos. Proof-of-stake allowed the size of a participant’s holdings of the particular cryptocurrency to determine their voting power for technical changes in the network, this creating internal economic factors which created centralization. </p>

<h3>A new consensus algorithm was needed: So Skycoin built Obelisk</h3>

<p>Born from an audit of the risks of first generation of cryptocurrency, Skycoin developers spent seven years researching and developing Obelisk. A consensus algorithm using a web-of-trust mechanism, Obelisk systematically build in a tendency towards long-term decentralization. </p>
<p>Obelisk corrects the centralizing tendencies and the major security flaws associated with other blockchain networks. The result is a blockchain network with no mining requirement, fixed supplies of crypto-tokens, 10-second transaction times, all while providing greater security. </p>
<p>In a system in which the connection between coin creation and control over the network is severed, crypto holdings lose their political function and begin to act more like a straightforward form of digital property. </p>

<h2>Skycoin is the only cryptocurrency backed by a commodity in high demand: Bandwidth </h2>

<h3>Cryptocurrency wasn’t alone in having dangerous centralization tendencies: Enter Skywire</h3>
<p>Centralized internet access raises the barrier to entry on innovation. The creation of the internet was a pivotal event in the course of human history. Access to information has revolutionized almost every part of our world today. However, internet service providers have centralized society’s access to the internet around geographic locations with access to capital— and also around only the businesses and individuals with the ability to pay more. And with control of entrance to the internet, ISPs can continue to charge more and more. </p>
<p>Our incentivized mesh network Skywire is the backbone of Skycoin. Users can earn income by powering the new internet, and use credits from powering the internet to access and share on the network themselves.  </p>
<p>As a decentralized mesh network it provides privacy, security, and independence. Its speed and adaptability creates boundless room for innovation. But more importantly, Skywire distributes the power long held by a small central body.</p>
<p>Innovation helps us all — Skycoin wants to empower it with Skywire. </p>
