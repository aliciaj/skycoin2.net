			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">What is Skycoin?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skycoin is the centerpiece of a large ecosystem; a currency for digital bandwidth, backed by the new internet. Fast transactions, no transaction fees & quantum resistance, Skycoin is a third-generation cryptocurrency supporting a new free and open internet.</p>

				<p>Skycoin's consensus algorithm, Obelisk, is designed to achieve true decentralization of blockchain consensus, replacing both Proof of Work (“PoW”) and Proof of Stake (“PoS”). The Obelisk algorithm distributes influence over the network according to a “web of trust”. In essence, every node has a list of other nodes that it subscribes to, and the density of a node’s network of subscribers determines its influence on the network. Each node is assigned a personal blockchain which acts as a “public broadcasting channel” on which all of a node’s actions are visible and publicly recorded. As all consensus decisions and communication occur through the personal blockchains of each node, the community can very easily audit nodes for cheating or collusion. How decisions on the network are made and which nodes influence those decisions is completely transparent.</p>

				<p>Skycoin is the cryptocurrency of Skywire. That means Skycoin has a practical application more than simply acting as another digital currency. Skycoin was meant to solve ALL problems associated with first generation cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>

			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Can I buy Skycoin? What are the exchanges with Skycoin listings?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skycoin is currently listed on 4 exchanges: C2CX, Cryptopia, 5iquaint, Coin918 (has fiat pairing), and localbitcoincash.org. More exchanges coming soon!</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		
		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">What is the form of skycoin distribution? </h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skycoin has a total supply of 100 million coins, from which 75% are time locked. The unlocked 25% are being distributed via several mechanism. Some funds are being used to build products, pay listing on exchanges, rent production facilities for the hardware components of Skywire (antennas, chips etc.), and of course there is Skywire. Skywire will be used to achieve fairest distribution possible by paying Skywire participants in Skycoin for providing bandwidth.</p>
				<p>After the first 25% are distributed, each year 5% are going to be unlocked but how much will be distributed is dependent on the network growth of Skywire. If necessary, the distribution process will be stretched out to up to 25 years.</p>

			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Are Skycoin transactions truly anonymous?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Transactions in Skycoin are currently not anonymous as there are other, more pressing topics to cover. However, the plan to make transactions anonymous is already finished and justs waits to be implemented. </p>
				<p>Skycoin natively supports a simplified CoinJoin protocol, meaning that multiple outputs are being put together and split up between the receivers. Private keys are perfectly random 256 bit numbers and addresses are public key hashs. Unless someone knows you’re private key and you are not reusing your address, you are somewhat anonymous. This is also known as being ‘pseudoanonymous’ like in Bitcoin.</p>
				<p>Later on sending to addresses that have already been used will be disabled but this won’t be an issue until quantum computers start breaking 64 or 128 bit ECC keys in the open.</p>

		</li>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">What are Coin Hours? </h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Coin hours are a parallel currency that functions as a transaction spam prevention mechanism. Because transactions free in Skycoin, coin hours are required to make transactions, and a certain amount are burned each time you perform said transaction.</p>
				<p>1 coin hour is generated for every 1 SKY you hold for 1 hour.</p>]
				<p>Coin hours are accumulated regardless of whether you have a wallet open. The coin hours are associated with public keys on the blockchain. So even Skycoins in a paper wallet will accumulate coin hours.</p>

				<p>In the future, coin hours will be tradeable on markets just like other coins.</p>

	<h2 id="nav-skywire">SkyWire</h2>

	<ul class="accordion">

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">What is Skywire?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skywire is an application and networking protocol that allows for SDN (software defined networking), what this means is that Skywire creates a virtual, secure, encrypted, network that does not care what type of hardware it is running over. This allows Skywire data packets to travel over the old internet or Skywire wireless mesh connections without knowing the difference. </p>
				<p>In Skywire there is no censorship, no tracking, no third party listening in - it is an internet that is truly private. This new technology, in time, will replace the old internet entirely.</p>
				<p>Skywire is an incentivized meshnet, meaning that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>you earn Skycoins by running a node.</li>
					<li>you earn Coin Hours by providing bandwidth to the network.</li>
					<li>you spend Coin Hours to get a priority of network resources over others.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</li>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">How will Skywire be used by the general public? </h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skywire will be pennies on the dollar cheaper than current ISPs, and will even have basic access for free. This is a huge breakthrough in technology. The Skywire platform will bring free internet to the entire world. Specific use cases where low latency and high data rates are required, users will be able to pay with coin hours to get priority service. This is a far more efficient system than the current internet, and will be much cheaper even for high demand users. Additional to that Skywire is designed to provide a scalable solution for the growing demand of the IoT &nbsp; VR market.</p>

		</li>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">How can Skywire regulate illegal, harmful or offensive content?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Users of Skywire will be able to choose what content they subscribe to, and therefore will not have to view any content they do not want to.</p>
				<p>Any data passing through a node will be entirely encrypted, so there is no way for nodes to know what they are forwarding. However if they know another node is a bad actor, they can blacklist that node from their connections, and no longer send or receive data from them.</p>

			</div>
		</li>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">How will Skywire bypass the ISPs and establish connections between all regions?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skywire is backwards compatible with current ISPs, but will eventually break free and be entirely independent by building it’s own wireless mesh internet. While Skywire runs over the legacy network, ISPs can’t throttle the traffic or observe it via DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) because Skywire uses pluggable transport, therefore it can be masked as any other protocol out there.</p>
				<p>This mesh internet is possible now with current unlicensed consumer technology. However, the Skycoin team is manufacturing their own wireless hardware that will be plug and play with the miner, soon to be released.</p>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Are there any calculations of return on investment for Skywire TestNet?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Part of the testnet’s purpose is to determine the reward structure. Various reward algorithms will be tested after launch, and whatever works best will be used for mainnet.</p>

			</div>
		</li>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">What about legalities of long range wireless transmission?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skywire will be operating on unlicensed radio bands with technology that is available on the consumer market now. Additionally, we will be developing new wireless hardware technology. Skywire will use radio frequencies that do not require a license.</p>

	<h2 id="nav-mining">Mining</h2>

	<ul class="accordion">

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">What is a Skywire Miner? </h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skywire miners are the backbone of the new internet. Skywire Miners are hardware specially designed to efficiently process encrypted, private data on Skywire and earn the operators of the miner passive Skycoin Coinhours income.</p>

				<p>The official position is to utilize ARM processors, since they do not have known backdoors like the intel ME or AMD PSP but Skywire can be executed on any processor out there. </p>

				<p>Later on hardware specific for Skywire like PCB boards and FPGA chips for encryption will be produced, to achieve even higher network speed & security while keeping the costs low.</p>
			</div>
		</li>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Can I build my own Skyminer?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>It is possible to build your own DIY miner. Many people are doing so now mostly using Orange Pi Primes like those that are used in the official miner, but many will also be trying non-standard hardware, as there will be a special Skycoin bounty for people who can provide data and feedback from their non-standard hardware to the developers. </p>
				<p>Some good places to find more info and other people working on DIY miners is through the @skywire Telegram channel, or the forum: skywug.net</p>

			</div>
		</li>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Is it possible to use my laptop, PC or phone as a Skyminer?	</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>You will be able to mine with any device that can run the Skywire application. Right now, it is built for all Unix platforms. Any device that can run Unix, should also be able to run Skywire. </p>
				<p>There will be support for more operating systems, and platforms in the future. Due to the fact that Skywire “Mining” is not actually ‘mining’ in the sense of solving difficult math problems, but rather forwarding internet traffic, it does not take a lot of computing power or electricity to get the job done. Therefore, DIY miners are commonly built with Orange Pi’s or Raspberry Pis because of the low power consumption and hardware costs.</p>

			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">Why is Skycoin much less-known compared to other cryptocurrencies?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Skycoin developers have put all of their effort into making some of the most amazing technology in all of the crypto world, and have not put much effort into getting the word out. So right now still nobody knows about it. Once marketing ramps up in 2018, this project will not be unknown for long.</p>

			</div>
		</li>

		<li class="accordion-item">
			<h3 class="accordion-thumb">What is the Skycoin marketing plan?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>Since the beginning, Skycoin developers have been focused developing actual software, that is why the development of the Skycoin project is so far ahead of many others! Much time and energy has been put into creating this new technology. Only recently has marketing begun to ramp up. Skycoin's plan for Q1 and Q2 of 2018 is to create assets that help people understand the technology -- from videos, to articles, to infographs. We want anyone who wants to learn about Skycoin to be equipped to do so, and anyone who could benefit from Skycoin technology to be able to access it.</p>
