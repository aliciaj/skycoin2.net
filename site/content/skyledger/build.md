<h2>CX / CXO Development Framework</h2>

<p>The Skycoin ecosystem includes its own programming language and immutable object system. These provide the foundation for application logic and data distribution on the Skywire network.</p>

<h2>CX Programming Language</h2>

<p>The Skycoin team developed the CX programming language as a deterministic language that can build more than just smart contracts, while also providing greater security and versatility. CX can be used to create decentralized applications, video games, and program FPGA chips. </p>

<h2>CX Object System (CXO)</h2>

<p>The distributed content sharing protocol CXO enables peer-to-peer replication of structured data that can only be modified by the publisher. With CXO, a publisher creates a data feed and signs it with their private key. Other nodes can subscribe to this data feed, making it available to the broader network. However, other nodes cannot alter the data feed without the publisher’s private key, and therefore ensuring data integrity can be trusted even if the file is not directly downloaded from the publisher’s original node.</p>

<p>With this, CXO combines the immutability associated with blockchain and the scalability of a content distribution network (CDN).This is useful in cases where content needs to be easily available and verifiable, but not necessarily stored on the blockchain. For instance, storing all of the content for a social media platform directly on the blockchain would lead to bloat as the platform gains adoption. Using CXO to store and distribute the content completely avoids this issue. </p>


<h2>Skysuite: Native Applications</h2>

<p>Skysuite is a set of self-contained applications that run natively on the Skywire network. Some of the applications currently in development include Sky-Messenger, an IM client; Skycoin BBS, a social media platform; Cryptosphere, a VPN client; and Kitty Cash, an ambitious successor to the wildly popular CryptoKitties game. </p>
