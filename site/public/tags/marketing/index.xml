      <description>Someone try  run a skycoin node with go run ./cmd/skycoin/skycoin.go go run ./cmd/cli/skycoin.go  This is the command line interface.  do go run ./cmd/cli/skycoin.go help GenerateWallet etc  You should be able to  generate wallets generate addresses check balances create transactions inject transactions into the network track transaction status  This is new code and still being heavily tested/modified. I would not use the 12 word wallet phrase feature yet.</description>

      <description>There are some improvements coming up - Deprecation of the C secp256k1 library for golang version - Dependency vendoring. Means all dependencies of skycoin will be inside of the skycoin repo, for version 1.5. Improves security, makes it so that no one can insert a back door in an upstream library - golang almost has deterministic builds working. This will be exciting. If two people build the binary from source on different machines, they get SHA256 identical binaries.</description>

      <title>Development Update #15</title>
      <link>https://www.skycoin.net/development-updates/development-update-15/</link>

      <description>Summary: Development is exhausting. We pushed too hard to get to launch and underestimated the time and effort required. Getting things working has been easy, but 90% of the effort is in achieving quality and has been impossible to budget for.
We are distributing development further. The project is being split into bite sized pieces, documented with specifications and additional developers are being hired to work on the individual components.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Marketing and Speculation</title>

      <description>Thoughts on Marketing and Speculation: Skycoin marketing is highly targeted at influence groups and communities who need to know about Skycoin. The objective of Skycoin marketing is to build out the community and build awareness. Skycoin is not doing broad marketing aimed at public to &amp;ldquo;pump&amp;rdquo; prices to unsustainable levels. Skycoin will not be paying Lady Gaga to make a Skycoin music video.
Marketing tactics designed to cause bubbles and bursts are great for speculators, day trading and people organizing the pumps, but conflict with Skycoin&amp;rsquo;s objective of low volatility and stable price levels.</description>
