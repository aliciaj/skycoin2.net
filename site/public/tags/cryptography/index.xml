      <description>Crypto Library: Bad news, the crypto library problem is severe. In the new upgrade the public key for 1 in 1200 private keys will be different. To standardize it to Bitcoin. Only one or two people should be affected and we will replace the coins if they are unable to get them out of the wallet and send us the private key.
Every single crypto library outputs different values for the same inputs for a subset of the keys and it is extremely frustrating.</description>

      <description>Fixes: Fixed dozens of bugs with the crypto library port.
The sipa and gocoin libsecp256k1 implementation differ slightly and output different public keys for the same private key for some inputs (every few thousand keys).
Slightly different public keys are outputted for the same secret key.

      <description>We had a productive day yesterday. Some people were able to get builds working immediately. Other people had problems with golang and path issues we are working through.
We launched the blockchain after a few hours of work. Fixed half a dozen bugs.  Several changes to build script Updated gvm curl build flags Updated to go1.4 Fixed bug with genesis block timestamp not accepting configuration setting Improved transaction malleability (more on this later) Fixed fprintf formatting bug in wallet names  Now:  I am refactoring /src/gui The wallet format on disc is JSON.</description>

      <description>Summary: We are exhausted. We just finished 4th cryptography audit. Some minor issues were found and fixed. All the issue involved impossible conditions, but are fixed anyways.
Cryptography Audit/Changes: Fixed:  Someone with a private key from a deterministic wallet who is able to do a SHA256 preimage attack was able to derive all subsequent keys in deterministic wallet (but not the keys for addresses preceding). SHA256 preimage attacks are currently impossible but may become an issue in thirty years.</description>

      <description>Cryptography Upgrades: We are getting a function for encrypting blocks of data with ECCDH. There will be simple function that takes a public key and encrypts to binary and a simple function that takes the recipients private key for decryption from bytes.
Encryption Format: struct EncryptedMessage { Pubkey Pubkey //ephemeral pubkey Q Data []byte //padded to 4096 bytes, length prefix and 32 bit checksum }  Their pubkey is P, your ephemeral pubkey is Q.</description>

      <description>Summary: We are doing a lot of writing and documentation right now. The white paper is being split up into three white papers. We are going to have a more general document on problems with Bitcoin and Skycoin&amp;rsquo;s long term approach to each problem. We want to emphasize the design differences and choices Skycoin makes.
Documentation is becoming more important. New users cannot read the whole thread and need a compressed and organized overview of the project.</description>

      <description>Summary: The hash function for Skycoin deterministic wallet generation is finished. We believe our new deterministic wallet hash function is the most secure hash function against GPU and ASIC brute forcing to date. We are using a new hash called &amp;ldquo;secp256k1 Hash&amp;rdquo; that combines SHA256 with elliptic curve signature operations.
Secp256k1 Hash Implementation: 1) SHA256 seed value 2) Compute deterministic private key, pubkey pair from seed value 3) Generate deterministic secp256k1 signature from seed and generated private key 3) Append signature to seed and compute its SHA256 hash</description>
