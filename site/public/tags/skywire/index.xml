      <description>In spring 2017, the FCC made a proposal in which internet service providers can collect, use, and sell information about customer browsing habits. ISPs can do this without permission. Customers can’t opt out. Being a customer of one of these corporations means that you’re paying to be tracked, plain and simple.
With customer tracking, unreliable coverage, high rates, long hold times and poor customer service, ISPs have become some of the most hated companies in America.</description>

      <description>Skycoin and Skywire are two separate components of the Skycoin Project. Skycoin is the blockchain. Skywire is the mesh network.
Skycoin was built first. It can stand on its own. It was created to address problems that Bitcoin has. The biggest problem that Bitcoin has is mining, which leads to the centralization of Bitcoin. The other problems that Bitcoin had mostly related to cryptography or software bugs, leading to problems such as transaction malleability.</description>

      <description>This post refers to Skywire earlier on in its formation, before it was named Skywire. Adapted from a bitcointalk post dated August 09, 2014.
Quote from: CraigM on August 09, 2014, 07:20:24 AM
 The meshnet is intended to be a nice privacy tool with benefits comparable to tor, but lower latency correct?
The meshnet is intended to allow funding nodes via micropayments in skycoin to cover bandwidth costs correct?</description>

      <description>Introduction Viscript Viscript is a cross platform CLI, and application launcher and for cluster management eventually. It is based on signal library as a signal server, so it can manage the signal clients, like node and the components in skywire. It can be run in GUI mode or headless mode.
Viscript GUI Screenshot: We can add app configurations in the config.yaml file, like the meshnet-socks-server:
 meshnet-socks-server: daemon: true desc: DESCRIPTION GOES HERE path: bin/meshnet/meshnet-run-socks-server default_args: [] help: | [1] Text name of app, must be unique [2] Node address which app will be talked with.</description>

      <description>Sign up to our mailing list for Skywire Miner updates: http://eepurl.com/c4DyAv
How can we create a truly free and open internet? To answer this question, we developed Skywire, the new alternative internet. Skywire is a groundbreaking, novel technology that takes control from large internet service providers (ISPs) and gives it back to the users. Its peer-to-peer model promotes net neutrality and sharing of content without blocking, slowdowns, or censorship. Skywire’s open-access network preserves privacy and encourages free speech.</description>

      <title>Skycoin/CXO vs FileCoin/IPFS</title>
      <link>https://www.skycoin.net/ask-the-developers/skycoin-vs-ipfs/</link>

      <guid>https://www.skycoin.net/ask-the-developers/skycoin-vs-ipfs/</guid>
      <description>We have been asked what is the difference between CXO and IPFS.
File Coin has the same objectives as a part of the Skycoin infrastructure, but is taking a different approach. They have three separate protocols:
 IPLD IPFS Multi-formats  where,
 IPLD is a representation language for immutable data objects and hashes. IPFS is a file system Mult-formats is a self describing data standard  In Skycoin, CXO does all three of those</description>

      <description>The internet gives us the illusion of control. We can socialize, consume, and do business instantly through services provided by Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. Seems convenient, right? It is – until you consider what you’re giving up.
We don’t control our lives online. Large companies and internet service providers (ISPs) collect our data, track our movements, and shape our experiences. Every time we use the internet, we give these companies total power over us.</description>

      <description>The Skycoin blockchain history JSON API is done: The first version of the Skycoin block storage library is done: The Skycoin CLI and WebRPC interface API is in progress: The first version of Skywire interface is done. It is being integrated with the JSON API now. You will have a number of &amp;ldquo;Nodes&amp;rdquo; that you control (your &amp;ldquo;personal cloud&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;personal botnet&amp;rdquo; really) For instance, for dropbox type storage This is actually a distributed multi-agent system.</description>

      <description>The coin is done. We are working on networking. There are three different groups working independently on that and its not on github yet.
The coin needs:  Database for storing blocks Database for history gui improvements Misc improvements (the blockchain does not save on windows when closing)  We have to move on to next part to keep schedule. Then new people can work on coin improvements. The improvements are marginal at this stage and could take up almost all the project resources if we only focused on that at this stage.</description>

      <guid>https://www.skycoin.net/development-updates/development-update-72/</guid>
      <description>Summary: The coin is basicly done. Other people can come in and polish up the hundreds of other things now. There are two developers working on front end and api, so will speed it along. Nothing else that is absolutely critical and not incremental needs to be done. There are still hundreds of small changes, improvements, refactoring to be done but it can be ignored for now.
After the coin distribution receipts are done, then schedule is cleared for consensus implementation and meshnet/darknet.</description>

      <guid>https://www.skycoin.net/development-updates/development-update-44/</guid>
      <description>This is over view of current development status and priorities
Consensus Consensus is being worked on. The earlier algorithms are being implemented, bench-marked. Then testing them against the newer algorithms, so we have comparison. This is currently in python. Will be moved to golang and integrated as soon as its ready.
This is not required for the distribution , because we can use central signing key until decentralized consensus is implemented.</description>

      <description>Skywire Repo Moved: The Skywire repository has been merged into the main Skycoin repository. Still being integrated to replace visor and daemon.
Skycoin Cryptography Standard Library All the cryptography, hashing and address operations have been moved into github.com/skycoin/skycoin/src/cipher
https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/tree/master/src/cipher
The library is in progress. It will be common core for addresses, hashing and cryptography across Skycoin, distributed applications and wallets.
The new library will support:  secp256k1 public and private key generation secp256k1 signature, signature verification and chksig operations Secure deterministic wallet generation operator (secp256k1 curve right multiplication with SHA256 hashing) Secure random number generation (mixes entropy from multiple sources on top of system secure random number generator) SHA256 merkle tree implementation for radix 2 and 16 ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman) deniable encryption with secp256k1 and ChaCha20 SHA256, Ripmd160, ChaCha20 implementation Base58 encoding for Skycoin and Bitcoin Addresses May in future specify binary wallet file format for key storage  Project Management: Dependency Difficulties Golang is a new language and dependency management is still difficult.</description>

      <description>Cryptography Upgrades: We are getting a function for encrypting blocks of data with ECCDH. There will be simple function that takes a public key and encrypts to binary and a simple function that takes the recipients private key for decryption from bytes.
Encryption Format: struct EncryptedMessage { Pubkey Pubkey //ephemeral pubkey Q Data []byte //padded to 4096 bytes, length prefix and 32 bit checksum }  Their pubkey is P, your ephemeral pubkey is Q.</description>

      <description>Skywire Meshnet The design is amazing. Skywire darknet router may be able to replace BGP and existing corporate VPN solutions. Its reverse comparable with IPv6 (IPv6 can be embedded over Skywire). Its very simple.
I dont want to talk much about this. Just have to finish implementation and get source code out there.
Skycoin Application Framework Extremely exciting. We have compiler for compiling Golang down to Javascript.
https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs
 Aether apps will be in Golang.</description>

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_rPNMTokwmBPFel1pZfLbTtTkooSWtGKrTLB3RbXIrI
We thought the new developers could learn golang in two days and its taking a bit longer, especially with getting up to date on the code base and what needs to be done and why its structured the way it is. Working on better system for coordinating the work.</description>

      <description>Skywire Everything was working in January; launch has been delayed because of refactoring. We are exhausted because of coding coin. Everyone wants to get coin over with and get meshnet working. We can get a lot of press on reddit by delivering the meshnet. People are rioting because of Comcast/net neutrality right now.
Everyone is ready to deploy nodes in their city, setup local meetings, develop hardware and coordinate deployment across North America.</description>

      <guid>https://www.skycoin.net/development-updates/development-update-10/</guid>
      <description>Summary: The new wire protocol is more work than expected. Instead of delaying launch by two weeks, to address these issues I am hacking together something that will get the network running.
Multiple software components need to be be refactored:  Daemon needs to be extended to support multiple connection pools with independent peer exchange and using a common listening socket gnet needs to be modified to support an introduction packet gnet packet handling callbacks need to be embedded in the gnet object instead of globals, to allow multiple gnet instances in the same application daemon DHT functionality for peer bootstrap needs to be abstracted to allow for retrieving bootstrap peers for multiple hashes.</description>

      <description>Development Updates: We are updating the Skywire protocol. This is the last thing on checklist before launch.
Blob Replicator: The Blob Replicator is done. Blob replicator is used for transaction replication and the emergency messaging system.
 https://github.com/skycoin/cxo  This uses a gossip protocol to replicate data among a swarm of peers:  A blob is a series of bytes. The id of a blob is its SHA256 hash On connect a peer receives a list of all the hashes of the Blobs the peer has.</description>
