      <description>The 5 Pillars of Skycoin
1. SKYCOIN A truly decentralized, 51% attack proof, lightning quick cryptocurrency that was designed to fulfill Satoshi’s original vision.
2. SKYWIRE A mesh network that allows you to earn Skycoin for forwarding traffic/bandwidth. This is a similar to Tor or BitTorrent, except that you will be paid to participate.
3. SKYLEDGER A platform similar to Ethereum’s ERC20 platform, in the way a 2018 Bugatti Chiron is similar to a 1992 Geo Metro.</description>

      <description>What’s the difference between Skycoin and Skywire? Skycoin is the cryptocurrency.  It was developed to address problems that Bitcoin could not solve. We created a revolutionary consensus algorithm called Obelisk that eliminates mining.
 Skywire is the mesh network.  Skywire was developed to address problems with the internet itself. Skywire can operate independently from Skycoin. It’s not the first attempt at a global mesh network, but it will be the first to succeed.</description>

      <guid>https://www.skycoin.net/infographics/why-do-we-need-a-free-internet/</guid>
      <description>Why are we building a free internet? It’s a long list so we’ll give you our top 3.
1.) Freedom All over the world governments both deny and restrict their citizenries access to the internet as well as censor opposing voices. They have forgotten who they serve.
2.) Privacy Governments &amp;amp; Corporations track and censor everything we do online. Whether it’s to get dirt on a political opponent or sell you the next new batman figurine… It’s wrong.</description>

      <title>Skycoin Digest: What do you think of Bitcoin? [INFOGRAPHIC]</title>
      <link>https://www.skycoin.net/infographics/what-do-you-think-about-bitcoin/</link>

      <description>Bitcoin was Amazing We all love Satoshi but what Bitcoin has become is not what he intended. Time and growth have highlighted the limitations of Bitcoin and there is no easy fix.
 Bitcoin is NOT decentralized. Three mining pools control all of Bitcoin. Transaction speeds can take hours or even days. Due to centralization, Bitcoin is highly vulnerable to a 51% attack. $40 transaction fees and climbing! Nodes can be arbitrarily taken over.</description>

      <description>Skycoin Market Making Bot: We have a market making bot, that will sit on the bid/ask for skycoin for the following exchanges - Poloniex - C2CX - Bittrex - Cryptopia
The bot is in java and has three different trading strategies you can set. It was developed by a third party and will be released publicly.
You can set rules, like a spread and if the price between two exchanges goes more than 5% difference the bot will automatically arbitrage the spread and make you money.</description>
