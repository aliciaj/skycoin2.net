I guess that Skycoin just want to test the water first. There is nothing wrong with that. They are engineers and want to do testing for everything. They have been very cautious for the development as well. This is something they are good at. Just do what you are good at.</description>

      <description>We had a productive day yesterday. Some people were able to get builds working immediately. Other people had problems with golang and path issues we are working through.
We launched the blockchain after a few hours of work. Fixed half a dozen bugs.  Several changes to build script Updated gvm curl build flags Updated to go1.4 Fixed bug with genesis block timestamp not accepting configuration setting Improved transaction malleability (more on this later) Fixed fprintf formatting bug in wallet names  Now:  I am refactoring /src/gui The wallet format on disc is JSON.</description>
