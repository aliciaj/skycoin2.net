How can we create a truly free and open internet? To answer this question, we developed Skywire, the new alternative internet. Skywire is a groundbreaking, novel technology that takes control from large internet service providers (ISPs) and gives it back to the users. Its peer-to-peer model promotes net neutrality and sharing of content without blocking, slowdowns, or censorship. Skywire’s open-access network preserves privacy and encourages free speech.</description>

      <description>The internet gives us the illusion of control. We can socialize, consume, and do business instantly through services provided by Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. Seems convenient, right? It is – until you consider what you’re giving up.
We don’t control our lives online. Large companies and internet service providers (ISPs) collect our data, track our movements, and shape our experiences. Every time we use the internet, we give these companies total power over us.</description>

 Regarding tha subject, how much compute power and memory would these nodes require? I saw the renders on telegram about the proposed hardware node, but I have a mining pc that has a mostly unused cpu and memory, thinking about a little upgrade on this side in the future.
 Response: Many hacking firms, used to take over peoples computers so they could put adware on them or build up a botnet, or do clickfraud to make websites look like they were getting more views than they actually are.</description>
