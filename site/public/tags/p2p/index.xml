      <description>I simplified the lowest level of the networking. I stripped everything out. - The mesh network protocol is now so simple that it can be operated by hand, over paper, punch cards or carrier pidgeon if the internet is destroyed and humanity loses the ability to use electricity. - the algorithm being used is scale invariant in time. It works over milliseconds, seconds, days, months, years, centuries. The key parameters between two links is the bandwidth/latency product (the bandwidth of the link in bits/second times the latency between when a message is sent and when the confirmation of receipt is received).</description>

      <description>The network has been operating for a few weeks now. It is working pretty well, but there are reliability issues over open internet that did not occur in the VPN testing environment.
The two major improvements that are needed are:  Queuing pending transactions, ensuring they are executed, blocking wallet from creating new transactions until existing transactions are executed, putting indicator in GUI to allow diagnosis of transactions that fail to propagate Major refactor of PEX (peer-exchange).</description>

      <description>There was a &amp;ldquo;disappearing coins&amp;rdquo; bug on windows.  You download all ~120 blocks, you see 100 coins You close client, there is not sig signal for clear program exit triggered on windows, so you lose all the blocks (they are not saved to disc, like they are on exit, on linux) You open client and the coins are &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo;, until you redownload the blockchain to current head  So coins were still there and appears to just be bug with blockchain not being saved to disc on exit on windows.</description>

      <description>Bug Fixes: Networking Yesterday, as soon as soon people started connecting to network, we found out how unreliable the internet is. People had difficulty connecting to servers. The majority of client did not have open ports so could not accept incoming connections. People had to wait hours for connections and then transactions were not propagating for some users, depending on country.
I disabled DHT and PEX and just hardcoded list of servers and then clients connected within half a second and it worked.</description>

      <description>The network is running. Fixed a bunch of bugs.
Structure of Skycoin Networking: This is overview of wire protocol. https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/blob/master/src/daemon/messages.go#L40

 Each message is a struct. You put values in struct, then do a &amp;ldquo;Send&amp;rdquo; and say who you want to send it to It packs up the struct in canonical binary format the struct has a .</description>

      <title>Ask the Developers #7</title>

      <description>Comment: Quote from: illodin on May 07, 2015, 12:05:22 AM &amp;gt; Is there any use of running &amp;ldquo;full nodes&amp;rdquo; or w/e they are called in Skycoin, i.e. running the client with port 6000 open?
Response: Yes. PM me your node IP address and I will add it to the default list.
Skycoin has two modes of peer-to-peer connections - DHT lookup - PEX
DHT is disabled by default now and pex is disabled until there is time to fix issue.</description>

      <description>Summary: Most of the work in last week has been in the new wire protocol repo. Should be on github soon.
