      <description>Comment: Quote from: iruu on May 18, 2014, 10:40:39 AM &amp;gt;A decentralized distributed consensus currency, so to speak. At least aiming to be decentralized. &amp;gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really get the why. Why not some variation of proof of stake? For example a version where one stake equals one virtual node. No need for trust when there&amp;rsquo;s financial interest.
Yes. We actually have two layers of proof-of-stake. There is the blockchain consensus, then within the blockchain we have coinhours, which are burned as fees.</description>
