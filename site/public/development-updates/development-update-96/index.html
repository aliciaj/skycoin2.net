<p>Finished some small things, but mostly design work</p>

<h5 id="there-are-some-minor-changes">There are some minor changes</h5>

<ul>
<li>UPNP support for Skycoin networking is done. Can tunnel through firewalls now.</li>
<li>Networking will probably be switched from TCP/IP to UDP</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exchange">Exchange:</h2>

<p>This is ready to go almost, but have to finish</p>

<h2 id="other">Other:</h2>

<p>The GUI for interaction with networking and meshnet configuration is extremely frustrating. I am trying to find some way to take a shortcut or make this easier.</p>

<ul>
<li>I need a cross platform pseudo terminal and a metacircular evaluator for golang. Very frustrating. There is nothing like ncurses that is cross platform.</li>
<li>I feel like this will require writing an application in opengl on top of SDL. This is annoying because the code base currently cross-compiles 100% and this will break that</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like I am rewriting a bunch of software from the 70s and 80s, such as ncurses and pseudo terminal multiplexing&hellip; I think if I just keep coding, that it will work out.</p>

<p>There is a new programming technique called CODA that is extremely powerful. TCP/ip implementation is about 20,000 lines in C. In Alan Kay&rsquo;s CODA type environment, TCP/ip type flow control can be implemented in 150 lines.</p>

<p>He was able to implement a full operating system from scratch, with document editor, email and a webbrowser, in 20,000 lines of code</p>

<p>The mesh network requires something like this and may have to implement a simple scripting language for this.</p>

<p>After two weeks, I figured out how to implement it in very few lines but still has to be implemented and debugged.</p>

<p>This is extremely occult tier mathematics.
- The programs in this language, do not have a representation as a text file
- The syntax looks exactly like golang
- All programs are deterministic
- The programs have a very elegant algebraic representation
- there does not appear to be a difference between local program objects and program objects on a remote machine
- the programs accept only length prefixed bytes as input and emit length prefixed bytes
-  it is recursive (turtles all the way down), in that you can instantiate a &ldquo;world&rdquo; or program context and within that context, instantiate three &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; or program contexts (own computers) and network them (top level passing messages between them) and run them. The top level programming context appears to be recursive.
- the programs are constructed by applying a series of operators on an object starting in a null state
- the programs themselves are program objects
- the meaning of the program or action of a statement upon the program state is not fixed, but defined in terms of another program object
- it is impossible to write software that is not open source in this language</p>

<p>When we use the computer, we do not interact with software objects. We interact mediated through the computer but not on &ldquo;computer objects&rdquo;, but rather interact with twitter, facebook, youtube mediated by the computer object, tool, interaction</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lSYUkKs.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There is a triangle like this, with
- the object on the left (representation, visual thing, object)
- the interaction/goal or outcome on the right  (pragmatics, what you are doing, the operation or action)
- the tool or action at the top (the intermediating thing, the tool that immediate between the object, the reification of the action)</p>

<p>An object starts as a null state, then a finite series of actions are applied to it
- a twitter feed starts empty and then &ldquo;create tweet&rdquo; actions are applied in series
- a coin starts with an unspent output set, then transaction actions are applied, that destroy unspent outputs and create new unspent outputs
- a text file is opened and begins empty, then a series of key press or &ldquo;insert characters&rdquo;, &ldquo;remove characters&rdquo; actions are applied
- a wikipedia page starts as a blank text file and then a series of &ldquo;apply diff&rdquo; actions are carried out upon the state</p>

<p>The state of the object and the sequence of reifed of the actions to the current states are dual. They are isomorphic and equivalent.
- starting with the null object and applying the actions in series to the state will yield the same result as transmitting the current state itself</p>

<p>This may seem abstract, but the reason it is important is that the nodes act like agents
- they have a goal (such as multiplexing packets across multiple connections)
- they have multiple things or actions they can attempt in order to possibly achieve the goal
- they have to choose a sequence of actions to accomplish the goal</p>

<ul>
<li>There are procedural or pragmatic aspects of actions (what an action does) (the result of applying the action to the program state)</li>
<li>There are declarative aspects of actions (when actions ca be applied, serialization for transmission over network)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is needed for constructing a program, which can be set with a goal and which can attempt a series of actions to accomplish that goal.
- &ldquo;retransmit messages from a list of messages, until a receipt confirmation has been received from the destination&rdquo;
- &ldquo;find a list of peer who each have data item that hashes to H&rdquo; (DHT lookup)</p>

<p>Downloading a file is
- &ldquo;find a list of peers who each have data item that hashes to H&rdquo;
- &ldquo;from the list of peers make download requests for chunks of file, until all chunks are received&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>there is a series of attempts to retrieve peers for the hash (DHT or super node)</li>
<li>for each peer, there is attempt to connect to them (may fail)
&ndash; for each connection attempt, there is an attempt to find a path to the peer (may fail)</li>
<li>for each connection, there is an attempt to make the chunk download request (may fail)</li>
</ul>

<p>This type of program is not procedural or declarative, but uses both and is defined in terms of behaviors.</p>

<ul>
<li>if file is not downloaded, find peers to who have the file which hashes to X</li>
<li>if peer is known, but are not connected, then attempt to connect to the peer</li>
<li>if connected to peer, requests chunks which have not been downloaded</li>
<li>if file is done downloading, terminate</li>
</ul>

<p>The language actually looks identical to golang, except that there is a meta-syntactic operator for creating higher order structures like behaviors, attributes, goals and higher order concepts for implementing things like this.</p>

<p>The language has everything stripped out, so I may be able to implement it in a few thousand lines. I am trying to figure out
- should I do this later
- should I do prototype first before writing this</p>

<p>The largest problem is that I dont have a pseudo-terminal that is cross platform and I need a meta-circular interpreter for driving the terminal gui widgets and the best way to do that is an early version of the scripting language.</p>

<p>The scripting language has added security benefit of being memory safe. In theory, you can strip out the whole operating system and just have a program for the networking drivers and another program for disc.</p>
